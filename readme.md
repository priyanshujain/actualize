# Actualize


"Actualize" is a lifestyle habit-tracking app anchored in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, with a goal to assist in navigating from basic physiological needs to the advanced stages of self-fulfilment and self-actualization.
In Maslow's hierarchy of needs, self-actualisation is the highest level of psychological development, where the personal potential is fully realized after basic bodily and ego needs have been fulfilled.

The app offers a systematic approach to personal growth by addressing each tier of Maslow's model through daily habits and reflections.
